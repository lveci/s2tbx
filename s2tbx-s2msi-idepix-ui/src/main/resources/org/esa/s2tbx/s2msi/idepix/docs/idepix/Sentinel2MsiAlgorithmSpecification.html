<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<h4>Neural network classification</h4>

<p>
    The Idepix classification algorithm for Sentinel-2 MSI is based on a 'feature extraction and classification'
    scheme which was originally developed in the frame of the
    ESA DUE GlobAlbedo project. It is described in detail in the project ATBD [1].
    In addition, various threshold tests are applied to identify cirrus clouds.<br> <br>

    As output, the neural net finally provides per pixel one of the properties 'cloud sure',
    'cloud ambiguous', 'cloud' (which means sure OR ambiguous) ,  'cirrus sure',
    'cirrus ambiguous', or 'snow/ice'.

<h4>Additional properties</h4>
<p>
    The following additional pixel properties are provided from the classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        'cloud_buffer': For pixels identified as cloudy, a cloud buffer of specified width can be set by the
        user to finally obtain a more
        conservative cloud mask. This is done in a post-processing step after the cloud classification has been applied
        on the full image. The cloud buffer algorithm works on pixel windows of size (2N+1) x (2N+1) with N = cloud buffer
        width. Note that the cloud buffer is only applied on cloud-free pixels, i.e. cloudy pixels are not flagged as cloud
        buffer of cloudy neighbour pixels.
        The cloud buffer procedure is described in a bit more detail in the CCI Land Cover ATBD [2].
    </li>
    <li>
        'cloud_shadow': For pixels identified as CLOUD, a cloud shadow algorithm can be optionally applied.
        In a first step, this algorithm determines
        the shadow from cloudy pixels by simple geometric calculations using the sun zenith angle and the cloud top
        height, which for Sentinel-2 MSI is actually set to a fixed value of 12km.
        In a second step, a cluster analysis is applied as an improvement to take into account the high
        spatial resolution of the MSI instrument.
        This cloud shadow procedure is described in more detail in the CCI Land Cover ATBD [1].
    </li>
    <li>
        'bright': A bright spectrum means that the intensity of the spectral curve (related to the albedo)
        should present relatively high values. However, a simple reflectance threshold test is applied for
        Suomi NPP VIIRS, using just the TOA reflectance at 443nm and the sun and viewing angles.
    </li>
    <li>
        'white':
        The whiteness classification is obtained from the 'feature extraction and classification' scheme.
        A white spectrum means that the spectral signature must be flat along the spectrum. The first derivative of the
        spectral curve should present low values, but noise and calibration errors may reduce the accuracy in the estimation
        of the spectrum flatness when computing the spectral derivative in channels with similar wavelengths.
    </li>
    <li>
        'brightwhite':
        The 'brightwhite' classification is obtained from the 'feature extraction and classification' scheme.
        Basically this means that the sum of brightness and whiteness feature values extend a certain threshold.
    </li>
    <li>
        'land': the pixel is located over land
    </li>
    <li>
        'water': the pixel is located over water
    </li>
    <li>
        'clear land': the pixel is clear and located over land. Here, the identification as 'clear' is obtained
        from a radiometric test within the feature extraction approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        'clear water': the pixel is clear and located over water. Here, the identification as 'clear' is obtained
        from a radiometric test within the feature extraction approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        'coastline': the pixel is a coastline pixel
    </li>
    <li>
        'vegetation risk': the pixel has a 'vegetation risk' if the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index),
        which for Sentinel-2 MSI is computed from the reflectances at 865nm and 665nm, exceeds a threshold of 0.5.
    </li>
    <li>
        'mountain_shadow': For all pixels, a mountain shadow algorithm can be optionally applied.
        This algorithm determines
        the mountain shadow from the sun and view angles and slope/aspect information computed from the altitudes
        in a given square around the considered pixel.
    </li>
</ul>

The 'land', 'water', and 'coastline' pixels are identified from an SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) land/water mask [3].
This is a fractional mask:
<ul>
    <li>
        water fraction = 0 : 'land'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction &gt; 0 and  water fraction  &lt; 100: 'coastline'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction = 100: 'water'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Final classification flags</h4>
<p>
    In summary, from the algorithm steps outlined above, the following final classification flags are provided for
    Proba-V:
<ul>
    <li>
        'INVALID' (input invalid or no classification possible)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD' (which means either CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS or CLOUD_SURE)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SURE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_BUFFER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SHADOW'
    </li>
    <li>
        'SNOW_ICE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'COASTLINE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'LAND'
    </li>
    <li>
        'WATER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLEAR_LAND'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLEAR_WATER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CIRRUS_SURE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'BRIGHT'
    </li>
    <li>
        'WHITE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'BRIGHTWHITE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'VEG_RISK'
    </li>
    <li>
        'MOUNTAIN_SHADOW'
    </li>

</ul>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>
    The determination of a cloud shadow is very difficult i.e. for the high spatial resolution provided by the
    MSI instrument. Therefore, the cloud shadow results may sometimes be rather poor.
</p>
<p>
    The following pixel properties are currently NOT provided for Sentinel-2 MSI:
<ul>
    <li>
        'GLINT_RISK'
    </li>
    <li>
        'MIXED_PIXEL'
    </li>
</ul>
