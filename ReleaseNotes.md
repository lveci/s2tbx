Sentinel-2 Toolbox Release Notes
================================

Changes in S2TBX 6.0
--------------------

### Main features

#### Sentinel-2 Product Reader

##### Read detector footprint masks per detector

The MSI instrument of Sentinel-2 is composed by different detectors, which have a different viewing geometry.
Some masks representing these detector for every band have been included in the reader, in order to identify
from which detector is coming every pixel.


##### Support for ZIP inputs

The Sentinel-2 reader is now able to read the zip products directly. It is no more needed to uncompress
the product before working with it in SNAP.

##### Sentinel-2B products

The new Sentinel-2B products are also supported by the Sentinel-2 reader.

#### Segmentation processor

The Generic Region Merging Processor allows the segmentation of images of arbitrary size.
It is based on the article A Scalable Tile-Based Framework for Region Merging Segmentation written
by Pierre Lassale, Jordi Inglada, Julien Michel, Manuel Grizonnet, and Julien Malik.

(http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7101250/)

#### Multi-size mosaic processor

A new algorithm that will be used when at least one of the input products is multisize,
otherwise the original mosaic operator is called.
This is fully operational for single granule Sentinel-2 products.

#### S2 Resampler processor

A new processor that allows to resample Sentinel-2 products having into account
the particularities of the angle bands.

#### OpenJp2 JNA

A new option for using a JNA wrapper for the popular OpenJpeg (OpenJp2) library has been included.
To activate it, the user have to create a new properties in the s2tbx property file. It has to be added:
use.openjp2.jna=true

#### Sen2Cor tool adapter

##### Advanced configuration

Now, it is possible to configure more parameters when running sen2cor from SNAP.
Before, the only parameter was the spatial resolution. Currently, the user can choose
whether terrain correction should be applied or not, the aerosol type, the ozone, the visibility...
and all the parameters available in the GIPP file of sen2cor.

##### Sen2Cor download and installation from SNAP

It is now possible to download directly from SNAP the current version of sen2cor and use it without installing anything else.
This beta version of the sen2cor plugin makes possible to execute sen2cor without installing Anaconda.

#### Sen2Three

Added support for the new product format introduced in autumn 2016 (PSD 14).

Changes in S2TBX 5.0
--------------------

### Main features

#### Sentinel-2 Product Reader

##### Support for PSD 14 Test product

In autumn 2016 a new product format will be introduced.
This new format features the following main evolutions:

- The product naming (including the naming of folders and files inside the product structure) has been compacted
- The products distributed on the Sentinels Data Hub will embed one single tile of the tiling grid
- A full resolution True-Colour Image (TCI) will be included in every product

(http://step.esa.int/main/sentinel_2l1c_evolution2016/)

The Sentinel-2 reader is now able to support the test product (PSD 14) available at this date for both L1C and L2A levels.
Other formats were implemented but could not be tested.
PSD 13 products are supported as before.

##### New RGB Profiles

More RGB profile are available: False-color Infrared, False-color Urban, Agriculture, Atmospheric penetration,
Healthy Vegetation, Land/Water, Atmospherical Removal, Shortwave Infrared, Vegetation Analysis.
RGB profiles over bands of different resolution can only be seen after resampling the product.

##### Tile Index Band

The different tiles/granules composing the full product overlap.
Some "tile_id" bands and masks has been included to indicate the granule from which each pixel is extracted.

##### Sentinel-2 Product Reader documentation

* Overview of the instrument
* Description of supported products
* Description of product format
* Description of some generated bands: angles, tile index

##### Other Sentinel-2 Reader improvements

Granules can now be opened without reading the main XML file

Performance optimisations were performed, it is now much faster to open a product:

- New method for reading the GML masks
- New method for metadata reading

Clean properly cache


#### New Processors

##### Reflectance to Radiance Processor

The Reflectance to Radiance Processor converts the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance to radiance from a given product.
The formula implemented is:

radiance = pixelValue * cosinus(radians(incidenceAngle)) * solarIrradiance * scale / (pi * d2)

(the variables are described in the SNAP help)

For Sentinel-2 the incidence angle is replaced with the values from the sun_zenith band.

##### Sentinel-2 Water Processor - MCI

The Sentinel-2 MCI Processor calculates the Maximum Chlorophyll Index by exploiting the height of a measurement over a specific baseline.

##### L3 processor integrated via the Standalone Tools Adapter

A new Sen2Three plugin is available to call Sen2Three from the S2TBX, based on generic StandAlone Tools Adapter.

Sen2Three is a level 3 processor for the Spatio-Temporal Synthesis of bottom of atmosphere corrected Sentinel-2 level 2a images.

(http://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2three/)


#### Non-native API Wrapper

##### OTB Python API inside SNAP Operator

A example explaining how to access OTB C++ application via Python API inside a SNAP Operator Plugin has been created.
The example demonstrates computing ndvi for a source product opened in SNAP through OTB

Changes in S2TBX 4.0
--------------------

### Main features

#### Sentinel-2 Product Reader

##### "Long Paths" issue on Windows

Multiple fixes for minimizing the impact of the "Long Paths" issue
on Windows OS. As long as you managed to uncompress a Sentinel-2 product
on your HDD from the Windows Explorer, it will open correctly inside SNAP

##### Only multi-size product reading

The specific 10m, 20m and 60m readers have been removed. They were doing
an automatic nearest neighbor resampling of any band to the target resolution,
and this work is much better done with the Resampling operator, available
via the Raster->Geometric Operations->Resampling menu.
The Resampling operator allows for more choices of the target resolution,
and allows one to choose the up and downsampling algorithms.

This also has the advantage that products where all granules are in the same
UTM zone are read automatically by a single reader, so does not trigger the
combo box for choosing the actual reader to use anymore.
Products containing granules in several distincts UTM zones still require the
user to choose which UTM zone to read.

The Level-2A reader, reading products produced by Sen2Cor, has been updated
to provide multi-size products, in line with what is done for L1C products.
It chooses the most precise resolution available for each band : L1C products
processed by sen2cor up to 20m will have B1 and B9 at 60m, and all other bands at 20m.
L1C products processed by sen2cor up to 10m will have B1 and B9 at 60m, B5/B6/B7/B8a/B11/B12 at 20m,
and B2/B3/B4/B8 at 10m.

##### S2 product can be opened using their directory

It is now possible to drag-and-drop the directory containing a S2 product
into the Product Explorer window to open them. No need to go find the xml
file anymore.

##### Reflectance scaling

The scale factor of 10000 used to convert reflectance from their raw integer
value to a meaningful reflectance value in [0, 1] is applied during product reading.

In the L2A product reader, appropriate scaling factors are applied to AOT and WVP bands
to produce physical values.

##### Metadata improvements

The granule-specific metadata were not easily distinguishable.
They now contain the MGRS tile identifier.

##### L2A Products now compatible with GPT

A small issue prevented L2A products from being used with the GPT.
This is now fixed.

##### Sun and Viewing angles

* The angles are now read at their original resolution, as provided in
the metadata (5000 m). This will reduce a lot the HDD space requirements
when converting S2 products to other format (BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF).

* The angles grids of adjacent tiles are automatically mosaicked.
Since their resolution (5000m) is not compatible with the distance
between two adjacent tiles (99960m), adjacent angles grid are interpolated
to produce a mosaic at 5000m resolution. This particular issue has been
reported to the S2-MPC.

* Viewing angles retrieval from the metadata was buggy in previous SNAP versions.
Now the Sentinel-2 reader produces one viewing angle grid for each band independently,
merging the different viewing angle grids of each detector into one single image.
For ease of use, a mean viewing angle grid is also provided, which averages
the data provided by each band-specific grid.
Their actual use in processors is still problematic since S2 products do not
provide precise enough information about the detector from which a reflectance
band pixel has been interpolated from. In the neighborhood of a detector switch,
the viewing angles thus cannot be trusted.

##### Product time information

S2 products now include proper time information (Sensing start/stop time).

##### Masks grouping

Masks are now grouped by category, to avoid the masks folder to be too populated.

##### Level-2A Scene Classification colors

The different indices of the Scene Classification now follow the Sen2Cor documentation.
For consistency, the masks generated for each class in the Scene Classification band 
also follow the same colors.

##### Level-3 Products support

Added support for the Level-3 products as generated by Sen2Three,
the multitemporal synthesis processor, developed by Telespazio Vega Gmbh

##### Reader optimizations

* OpenJPEG, the underlying tool which decompress the JP2 images has been updated
to include important performance optimizations.

* The reading of cloud masks (opaque_clouds and cirrus_clouds) available in L1C products,
and copied as-is in L2A products by Sen2Cor, can be disabled in the
preferences (Tools->Options->S2TBX). For cloudy S2 products, the loading time
can be very high because of the reading of the cloud masks.
In addition, L2A products provide a far more optimized opaque clouds/cirrus masks
in raster format, as part of the Scene Classification band, making the cloud masks
available in L1C products useless.

* The interpretation of GML masks has been optimized

#### Spot 6/7 reader

##### RGB rendering

RGB rendering of Spot 6/7 products appeared overly dark. These has been fixed, 
by not using the histogram provided in the metadata.

The order of the bands has been fixed for the default profile.

#### Cache management

The Sentinel-2 Toolbox caches uncompressed regions of the JPEG2000 files
read by the Sentinel-2 reader, the generic JP2 reader and the Spot 6/7 reader.
Those files are stored in the user home directory and can grow big.

The cache can now be emptied regularly at startup. The frequency of the cache
clean up can be tuned in the preferences pane.
The default behavior for new installation is to remove from the cache the files
that are more-than-a-week old.

#### New L2B Biophysical Products processor

The Sentinel-2 Toolbox now provides a biophysical products processor,
developped by CS and INRA.

The processor computes LAI, FAPAR, FCOVER, CWC, CCC from top-of-canopy reflectances.

#### New IdePix Processor

The Sentinel-2 Toolbox now includes the Idepix Processor for Sentinel-2,
developped by Brockmann Consult Gmbh.

The Idepix Processor provides a pixel classification into properties 
such as clear/cloudy, land/water, snow, ice etc.

The Sentinel-3 Toolbox provides similar functionnality for MODIS
and Landsat-8 data.

#### New Radiometric Indices Processor

The Sentinel-2 Toolbox now includes an important number of well-known
radiometric indices processors, developped by CS-Romania.

The following indices are made available :
* Vegetation indices : DVI, RVI, PVI, IPVI, WDVI, TNDVI, GNDVI, GEMI, ARVI,
NDI45, MTCI, MCARI, REIP, S2REP, IRECI, PSSRa
