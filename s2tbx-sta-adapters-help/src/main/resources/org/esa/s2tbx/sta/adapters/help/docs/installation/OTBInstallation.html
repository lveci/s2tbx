<h3>OTB Standalone Tool Installation</h3>

Before integrating it in SNAP, OTB needs to be deployed. Two options are available:
<ul>
    <li> Portable version </li>
    <li> Installable version: installer to execute</li>
</ul>


OTB can be freely downloaded from its website: <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org">
    <param name="text" value="<html>https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org</html>">
</object> <br>
Download and install/unpack OTB before integrating it in SNAP.

<h3>OTB Integration in SNAP</h3>
Once OTB is unpacked or installed you have to install the plugin. <br>
First define the OTB_BIN_DIR environment variable as the full path to the "bin" directory of your OTB installation.
Then from SNAP, go to Tools/Plugins, under the "Available Plugins" tab the OTB appears
(if it doesn't, check your internet connection and your proxy settings from tools/options>WWW).
Tick the checkbox next to it, click install and follow the instructions.<br>
